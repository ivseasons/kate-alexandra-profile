                            Dr. Kate Alexandra, DMA (she/her) is a private teacher, educator, and performer based in Chicagoland. In 2019, Kate earned her doctorate in double bass performance with a cognate in arts administration from the University of Cincinnati, College-Conservatory of Music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout her career, Kate has been an advocate of arts education as a way to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion. She embodied this praxis with her doctoral project in which she commissioned a selection of works by nine women composers and highlighted the need for representation among composers and inclusion among bass performers. Her dedication to bringing new and different perspectives to double bass repertoire resulted in the recording of these works, as well as a world premiere at the International Society of Double Bassists Convention in 2023.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an educator, Kate has consistently sought ways to increase access and representation as an extension of her doctoral research. Most recently, Kate taught remote lessons to her students at Withrow University High School (Cincinnati, OH), where she had previously held several workshops, coached chamber music, and instructed group lessons. Kate presented educational workshops for high school students on topics such as efficient and effective practice methods, bowing distribution, and ear training. These workshops were sponsored and funded in part by concert:nova and the Benjamin Carlson-Berne Scholarship Fund, whose mission is to expose economically disadvantaged children and youth to classical music. From 2017 to 2019, Kate worked as the music theory instructor and teaching assistant at the Cincinnati Double Bass Institute. Kate has also delivered a presentation for music specialists on chamber music with double bass obbligato. In 2019, Kate premiered five new works with double bass for Cincinnati Soundbox at the 21c Museum Hotel.
